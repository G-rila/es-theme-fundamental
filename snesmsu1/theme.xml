				<text>The SNES-CD/Sony Play Station is a prototype 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo and Sony that was never released. The MSU1 is an expansion chip, not entirely unlike the SuperFX, SDD-1, CX4 or the DSP series used in games such as Yoshi’s Island, Star Ocean, Mega Man X 2 and most games with scenes in Mode 7. Consequently, it is a part of the game cartridge. A common misconception is that supporting the MSU1 in hardware would require modifying the main SNES unit, and that it therefore does not “count”. Unfortunately for those who would make this mistake and stick to it, that would disqualify the expansion chips listed above as well. Perhaps the misunderstanding occurs because in emulation, it is the emulator itself that needs to be modified to support the MSU1 – just like it’s the emulator itself that brings support for the SuperFX et al. </text>
