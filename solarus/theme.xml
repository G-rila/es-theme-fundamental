				<text>Solarus is a free and open-source game engine, licensed under GPL v3. It is written from scratch in C++ and uses SDL2. Consequently, it is available on a large set of machines. It’s not an emulator neither a Super Nintendo™ ROM hack.

Development began in 2006. The goal of the engine is to allow people to create their own Action-RPG games (also called Zelda-like games). It is totally independent from Nintendo.

Solarus does not contain any copyrighted code or assets: it is 100% free and open-source. Thus, Solarus cannot be eligible for a DMCA from anyone, including Nintendo.</text>
